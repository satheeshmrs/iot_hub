# IOT Edge:

This lecture introduces the concept of IoT Edge, highlighting its role in deploying smart devices within an IoT environment. Here are the main points:

Local Processing: IoT Edge allows devices to run analytics and business logic locally, minimizing reliance on cloud processing. This leads to faster response times, reduced bandwidth costs, and lower server load.

Practical Applications: Examples include a smart camera that identifies suspicious objects and only sends relevant data to the cloud, and a temperature sensor that notifies users when limits are surpassed.

Key Components:

IoT Edge Models: Containers run Azure services, third-party services, or custom code on the device, executing the core logic.
IoT Edge Runtime: Manages models, ensures security, monitors device health, and facilitates cloud communication. It must be installed prior to deploying any models.
Cloud-Based Interface: Enables remote monitoring and management of devices connected to IoT Edge.
Architecture Overview: The architecture illustrates how devices connect to the IoT Edge runtime and the cloud via the IoT hub.

Cost Structure: The IoT hub used with IoT Edge follows standard pricing; however, the IoT Edge runtime is free to deploy. Costs for models depend on whether they are developed internally or by third parties.

Overall, this lecture provides a solid foundation on IoT Edge and its practical use cases. If you have any further questions or need clarification on specific points, feel free to ask!
